MinD is a professional web content filtering software. It born as a fork of Dansguardian project.

MinD is a redundant acronym of MinD is not Dansguardian, in honor to the famous proxy.

MinD and Dansguardian are very different. Dansguardian is a content filtering proxy but mind is a complete set of tools for web filtering. MinD is not a proxy, but you can use it with any proxy by using ICAP, RPC or any other protocol supported in a near future.
