#domains in banned list
#Don't bother with the www. or the http://

#The bannedurllist is for blocking PART of a site
#The bannedsitelist is for blocking ALL of a site

#You can include .tld so you can match .gov for example.

#The 'grey' lists override the 'banned' lists.
#The 'exception' lists override the 'banned' lists also.
#The difference is that the 'exception' lists completely switch
#off *all* other filtering for the match.  'grey' lists only
#stop the URL filtering and allow the normal filtering to work.

#An example of grey list use is when in Blanket Block (whitelist)
#mode and you want to allow some sites but still filter as normal
#on their content

#Another example of grey list use is when you ban a site but want
#to allow part of it.

#To include additional files in this list use this example:
#.Include<@DGCONFDIR@/anotherbannedurllist>

#You can have multiple .Includes.

# Time limiting syntax:
# #time: <start hour> <start minute> <end hour> <end minute> <days>
# Example:
##time: 9 0 17 0 01234
# Remove the first # from the line above to enable this list only from
# 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.
