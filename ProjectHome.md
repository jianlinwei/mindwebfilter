# MinD #

## Description ##

**MinD is a Web Content Adaptation and Filtering System** which has two branched: Toy and Blaster versions.

Its name is a recursive acronym for MinD is not Dansguardian.

The first branch (Toy) is a fork of Dansguardian Project version 2.10.1.1 with several improvements like:

  * Filtering performance has been increased significantly.
  * New "Simple Proxy" work mode was added (Now Squid or others proxies are not necessary to use the content filtering).
  * Event and filter logging were improved.
  * The blocking page and it's configuration were rewrote.
  * New Transparent Proxy work mode.
  * New domains categorized lists were included with millions of updated URLs.
  * New "safe search" option has been added to force search engine to make secure searches.

And others...

The Blaster version is a real Web Content Adaptation and Filtering System, and it is under development right now.

Both has as a main target to give to all the people an easy-to-use filtering tool that help to protect families against Internet inappropriate content.

The Toy version exists right now. it can be used for filter Web contents at small places with a minimum hardware.
Two or three hundred of Internet users can be filtered with a really small hardware like a single 500MHz or less CPU and 250 Mb RAM.
The main weakness of Toy version is it is not scalable. It is great for houses, educational institutes, training centers, schools, etc. but it cannot be used at large sites like ISPs or large companies.

The "Toy" name comes from it is something you can use to "play" but it's not a professional content filtering yet.

The Blaster version is under development yet. But it is designed for Web Content Adaptation and Filtering for large companies, ISPs, etc.

## Our commitment ##

  * MinD always will be Free Software under GPL licenses.
  * MinD is free for cost. Always has been and always will be.
  * MinD Team will always answer all message we receive.

## Why Fork? ##

First of all, I wish to thank Daniel Barron and Dansguardian team for the work they did.

The only reason for this fork is the main target of both projects is significantly different. Dansguardian aims is to be a proxy, just a proxy like Squid. Moreover, MinD aims is to be a professional Web Content Adaptation and Filtering Tool for all the users.
After exchanging some emails with Daniel, he gave us him approval for forking the project.

## Helping MinD Project ##

MinD Team has limited resources and a lot of work to do. We are just giving the first steps of a long, long trip. There is many ways you can help, even if you are not a developer or does not count with too much time. Here is a list of thinks you can do:

  * **Using MinD:** Just by using MinD you are helping us. If MinD becomes popular, it increases the chances for finding more hands for developing MinD.
  * **Requesting some new improvement or functionality:** As MinD Team has limited resources, is important to lead the effort in the correct way. There are many paths we can take, we have two branches and the development is just starting. Please do not hesitate to send your feedback.
  * **Reporting a bug:** MinD Team counts with a Testing Laboratory, some test cases are already automated but not all. To finding bugs is a hard work, please if you find a bug do not hesitate to report it to us.
  * **Tell us your experience:** There are many things we can improve and usability is very important in a project that tries to be used by all users. We will happy to read your comments.
  * **Writing / Translating documentation:** We think to document is as important as developing. And we have a lot of documentation task to do. If you help us with the documentation, the saved time can be used for continue development.
  * **Designing / Developing the web interface:** MinD team is also developing a Web GUI for MinD Toy. It would be great if you're a web developer or a designer and could give us a hand with GUI related taks.
  * **C/C++ Developing:** MinD is developed in C and C++. We have too much work to do. If you want to participate we will be very grateful.

Please do not hesitate to ask what you can do for MinD. The current budget of the project is very low, but we can always include your name in the credits.

Thank you,

-MinD.
